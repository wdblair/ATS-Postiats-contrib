(* Reference Counting *)

(*
  Since formulas are linear, we only allow you to use one once. If a term
  appears multiple times in an expression, just up its reference count.
  
  ^ is a prefix operator to increment the reference count of a linear term,
  and to obtain a new reference to it.
  
  In actual code, this looks a little messy.
